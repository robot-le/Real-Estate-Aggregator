# [Real Estate Aggregator](http://django-env.eba-n3zgzxbv.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

The point of the project is to make finding an apartment for rent easier. This service extracts data with web scrapers from several rental advertisement sources and stores these ads in one place, so you don't need to search for rent on tons of websites.

### Technologies:
- Django;
- Scrapy for scraping data;
- PostgreSQL for storing data;
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk for hosting service;
